# Digital Twin Ship
{: .fs-9 }
Today’s maritime engineering systems are operating in highly dynamic environments. The challenge is to
develop a concept leveraging on the different levels of system specific services already provided by
manufacturers, where safety and efficient performance of complex integrated systems can be managed from
the early stages of a new build vessel project and throughout the vessel’s life-cycle, Fig.1.

The goal of the research project is to develop digital twins of maritime systems and operations, 
which is an open virtual simulator as the next generation of marine industrial infrastructure not only for overall system design, 
allowing configuration of systems and verification of operational performance, but also more focusing to provide early warning, 
life cycle service support, and system behavior prediction, Fig.2.

This project will implement the research results into practical
demonstrators using framework in design processes, training, system maintenance and life cycle service.
There will be a strong industry involvement in the development of these demonstrators.  Demo simulators will be made at 
[Offshore Simulation Centre](https://osc.no/) dome and NTNU's “Remote control lab” at NMK II, Fig. 3.

**Project vision:** “A strong Norwegian marine industry through world leading competence and
knowledge on simulation based design and digital simulation of complex maritime operations and
maintenance”.
