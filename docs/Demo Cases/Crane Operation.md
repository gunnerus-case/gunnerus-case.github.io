# Crane Operation
The Gunnerus ship is fitted with a foldable knuckle boom crane for diverse lifting and loading tasks, Fig.1.
The Palfinger marine crane (PK 65002 M) has a compact design suitable for small vessels with limited space. Specifications of the model type is shown in Tab. 1.

|Crane Type|Outreach (m)|Lifting Capacity (kg)|Lifting Moment (kNm)|Total Moment (kNm)|Pedestal Outer Diameter (mm)|Slewing Angle (Â°)|Operating Pressure (bar)|Dead Weight (kg)|

The demo simulation case of crane operation uses the following models of the Gunnerus twin, Tab.2. These includes all models in the DP case as crane operations can only be carried out when the ship is stable.
The crane operation case has also compensation controllers for the crane and winch. These compensation controllers are optional. The crane controller can compensate the crane tip motion in 3DOF within its reach limits. The winch controller compensates the vertical motion of the load.
